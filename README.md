# LED-Sequencer
PCB designed using Altium designer as a practice project to learn Altium.
Created following a YouTube tutorial linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ5_7gQ1bIM&list=PLGqmHfPRKhwrl4rLZ9Hpkqo6NKDypoAPY&index=2

PCB takes a 5V power source to a two-pin header and uses a timer and decade counter IC to sequentially illuminate a row of 10 LEDs.
The speed of the LED sequence can be adjusted manually using a potentiometer on the PCB.

Possible applications include a sequential turn signal for motor vehicles.

Possibles improvements to the desing could be to replace the potentiomenter with a pre-determined resistor value to reduce manufacturing costs if speed adjustment is not required.

This project was originally completed in June of 2023, but was not uploaded to GitHub until August of 2023.
